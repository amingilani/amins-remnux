Amin's Portable REMnux Lab
==========================

I needed a reverse engineering environment for Information Security labwork for a [course](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6265-information-security-lab). I decided to
make a personalized portable lab based on REMnux that suits my workflow.

Please just use the official REMnux. There's no reason why anyone else might
find this helpful.
